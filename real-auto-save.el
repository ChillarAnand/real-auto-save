;; Put this file in a folder where Emacs can find it.

;; Add following lines to your .emacs initialization file
;; to enable auto save in all programming modes.

;;     (require 'real-auto-save)
;;     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'real-auto-save-mode)

;; Auto save interval is 10 seconds by default.
;; You can change it to whatever value you want at any point.

;;     (setq real-auto-save-interval 5) ;; in seconds
